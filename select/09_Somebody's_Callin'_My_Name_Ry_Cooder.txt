Ry Cooder Somebody's Callin' My Name

You better Hush, hush, hush, hush
Somebody's calling my name
Hush somebody's calling my name
Hush, hush, hush, hush

Somebody's calling my name
Crying oh my Lord, oh my Lord
What shall I do
What shall I do

Than you can call for you mother
But your mother can't do you no good,
Call on your mother,
Your mother can't do you no good

Call for your mother,
Your mother can't do you no good,
Crying oh my Lord, oh my Lord
What shall I do
What shall I do
