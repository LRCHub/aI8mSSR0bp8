In the shadow of the night I hear you calling out my name
Never heard your voice before, yet it sounds the same
As I had imagined it on a thousand nights before
Never thought you'd come for me, lost forevermore

But I can hear you calling, calling me home
I can hear you calling, calling me home

I can feel the pounding of his heart within my breast
Ever beating, ever drumming, it never seems to rest
It drives me on, leads me where my other senses fail
Leads me down this road to you, lit with moonlight pale

And I can hear you calling, calling me home
I can hear you calling, calling me home

As I approach the clearing, I recognize this place
And you with the heavens, shining in your face
A spirit strong and gentle, I ache to hold you in my arms
I feel as I have fallen under some forgotten charm

And I can hear you calling, calling me home
I can hear you calling, calling me home

Vapor in the midnight air, a vision there you stand
A broadsword and an eagle feather in your hands
I know not of me body quakes with passion or with fear
But as I reach my arms to you, you disappear

But I can hear you calling, calling me home
I can hear you calling, calling me home

Awake I sit bolt upright, I'm safe within my bed
The power of your calling still echoes in my head
Who or what you are, I guess I'll never really know
But every time you come for me, I'll go

I can hear you calling, calling me home
