I can hear the church bells ring from your garden wall
Will you come away with me or leave me here to fall?
I have traveled more than miles, crossed a great divide
Though we may be worlds apart, you're always by my side
By my side

So lay down your head and dream of me
When the autumn leaves are fallin'
And when you awake, you'll find me there
By the river, I'll come callin', I'll come callin'

You've been kept behind a wall, oh, so dark and gray
They can't build one high enough to keep my love away
Love away

So lay down your head and dream of me
When the autumn leaves are fallin'
And when you awake, you'll find me there
By the river, I'll come callin', I'll come callin'
I'll come callin'

So lay down your head and dream of me
When the autumn leaves are fallin'
And when you awake, you'll find me there
By the river, I'll come callin'

So lay down your head and dream of me
When the autumn leaves are fallin'
And when you awake, you'll find me there
By the river, I'll come callin'
By the river, I'll come callin'

You know I will, yes I will
You know I will, yes I will
You know I will, yes I will
